## This Project is where I keep the source code for olavorw.com

olavorw.com is a personal website that I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as kind of a portfolio or memorybook of the projects that I've built. It's also kind of a streaming website for my streams. I have pages for merchandise, donations, etc.
